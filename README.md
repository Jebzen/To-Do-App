# To Do App

A standard To-Do application made in React.Js from VITE

## Features and development

All features were prompted by ChatGPT by the following prompt:

`Give me a list of functions of a regular to-do application`

This gave me the following features to create for this application:

- Task creation: Users can create new tasks to be completed and set due dates or deadlines.

- Task organization: Users can categorize or group tasks based on priority, project, or context.

- Task management: Users can mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, or move tasks to a different category.

- Reminders: Users can set up reminders for tasks that need to be completed by a specific date or time.

- Notes: Users can add notes to tasks to provide additional context or details.

- Collaboration: Users can share tasks or task lists with others for collaboration and coordination.

- Search: Users can search for specific tasks or keywords within their task list.

- Integration: Users can integrate their to-do list with other productivity tools, such as calendar or email applications.

- Synchronization: Users can access their task list from multiple devices and have their changes synchronized across devices.

- Prioritization: Users can prioritize tasks based on urgency, importance, or impact.

- Progress tracking: Users can track their progress on tasks and see how much work is left to complete.

- Customization: Users can customize the interface or settings of the application to fit their preferences or needs.
